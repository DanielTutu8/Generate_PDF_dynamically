# Generate_PDF_dynamically
Generate PDF with iText and get data from MySQL Database

With this program you can create your own PDF based on some data from a database

Here I made a bill based on necessary data for bills taken from a database
The simplest way is with iText which is a library that helps you create a PDF file and you can arrange and add data in to your own way

Cheers!
